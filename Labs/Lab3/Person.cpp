/**
 *  TO DO:
 *  Refer to Person.h. Person.h acts as an interface to the Person object.
 *  It displays the private variables associated with Person and the member 
 *  functions that are used to 1) mutate or change the variables (i.e. mutator 
 *  functions) and 2) access or return the variables (i.e. accessor functions). 
 *  Without these functions we would not be able to change or even access the 
 *  private variables.
 * 
 *  Only Person(), Person(...), updateName(), and getName() are completed. 
 *  Follow the examples below to complete the remaining member functions of Person.
 *  Note that the name of the object + "::" comes before the name of the function. 
 * 
 *  For example, void Person::updateName(...).
 * 
 *  Not the only some part of moveLocation() and isOlderThan() are included. This was
 *  so the comments could be neatly placed to explain what they do. 
 *  
 *  Make sure to include comments before the functions similar to Lab 2.
 * (Recommended to use DoxyGen)
 * 
 *  Remaining functions to implement are:
 *  - updateAge()
 *  - updateOccupation()
 *  - movedLocation() // returns the opposite of is_from_IE
 *  - getAge()
 *  - getOccupation()
 *  - getLivesInIE() 
 *  - isOlderThan()
