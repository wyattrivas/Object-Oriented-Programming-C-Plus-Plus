 *
 * For this lab we will be learning how to organize data using the data structures, arrays and vectors. 
 * We will also learn the similarities and differences between the two of them in terms of how they contain, access and updates elements and how to pass them into functions. 
 * Lastly, we will learn and understand how the data structures allocate memory and their relation to pointers.
 * {Describe 1) what was most challenging and 2) how you solved/overcame the problem OR
 * the directions of how you PLAN to solve it}
